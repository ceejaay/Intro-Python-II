# Main
#

# Make a new player object that is currently in the 'outside' room.

# Write a loop that:

while parse_text.get_text is not False:
    command = input(">> ")
    print(parse_text.get_text(command))

#
# * Prints the current room name
# * Prints the current description (the textwrap module might be useful here).
# * Waits for user input and decides what to do.
#
# If the user enters a cardinal direction, attempt to move to the room there.
# Print an error message if the movement isn't allowed.
#
# If the user enters "q", quit the game.
